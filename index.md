TripScore is a travel tracking and gamification application that automatically tracks your travels, awards points, and enables competition with friends through leaderboards and achievements. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.

By using TripScore, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access the App.

## Information We Collect

We collect several types of information to provide and improve our service to you.

### Personal Information

When you create an account and use TripScore, we may collect the following personal information:

**Account Information:** When you register, we collect your name, email address, profile photo, and home country. This information is used to create and manage your account.

**Authentication Data:** If you sign in using third-party services (Google, Apple, Facebook), we receive basic profile information from those services, including your name, email address, and profile picture.

**User-Generated Content:** We collect photos, captions, comments, and other content you choose to share on the social feed within the App.

**Communication Data:** If you contact us for support or feedback, we collect your name, email address, and the content of your messages.

### Location Information

TripScore requires access to your device's location to provide core functionality:

**Precise Location Data:** We collect real-time GPS coordinates to automatically detect when you travel to new countries and cities. This data is used to calculate travel points, update your travel history, and display your trips on the map.

**Background Location Tracking:** With your explicit permission, we collect location data even when the App is not actively in use. This enables automatic trip detection without requiring manual entry. You can disable background location tracking at any time in your device settings, though this will limit the App's automatic tracking functionality.

**Location History:** We store historical location data to maintain your travel records, calculate statistics, and display your travel map. You can request deletion of this data at any time.

**Log Data:** Our servers automatically record information when you use the App, including IP address, access times, browser type, and pages viewed.

**Crash and Performance Data:** We collect crash reports, error logs, and performance metrics to identify and fix technical issues.

### Flight and Travel Information

**Flight Details:** When you add flights manually, we collect flight numbers, airline names, departure and arrival airports, dates, and times.

**Trip Information:** We collect trip type (holiday or work), destination names, trip dates, notes, and any photos you upload for specific trips.

**Travel Preferences:** We collect information about your travel patterns, favorite destinations, and trip frequency to personalize your experience.

### Social and Competitive Data

**Competitive Data:** We collect your points, rankings, badges earned, streaks, and competition history.

### Photos and Media

**Photo Uploads:** When you upload photos to the App, we collect the image files and any associated metadata (e.g., location tags, timestamps).
